							<h2>Intro</h2>
							<p>I hold a BSc in Marine Biology with a Year in Industry (First Class Honours) at Swansea University/Prifysgol Abertawe and a MSc in Marine Environmental Management (with distinction) at the University of York.</p>
							<p>During which, my work has taken me from west Wales to the Dutch Caribbean and to Puerto Rico, where I have worked alongside national parks and globally recognised research organisations, both leading and assisting with scientific research. My current masters degree has allowed me to work remotely alongside the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology (Gates Coral Lab) during the COVID 19 pandemic. </p>
							<p>Immediately upon joining my undergraduate degree I joined the University scuba diving society. My love for scuba diving quickly grew, leading me to becoming a BSAC sports diver with over 100 logged dives. The majority of these dives were located in the beautiful, warm and diverse waters of the Caribbean, where I worked alongside marine park rangers maintaining the St. Eustatius Marine Park.</p>

						<p>Throughout and alongside my academic experience, I have always been an ardent lover of presenting, with lecturers and tutors describing me as confident and televisual, even flamboyant. Particularly, I am interested in communicating science in engaging, accessible and creative ways to the public, to inspire individuals to act, protect and engage with the natural world. </p>
						<p>In November 2020, at the Western Society of Naturalists conference,  I presented a spatiotemporal analysis of in situ sea temperature across model <i>Montipora Capitata</i> populations in Kāne'ohe Bay, Hawai'i. I completed this project in association with the Hawai'i Institute of Marine Biology.</p>

								<li>Performed routine fish husbandry, including; cleaning of tanks, feeding of fish, checking water quality and removing mortalities.</li>
							  </ul>

							  <b>Marine Team St Eustatius National Parks Foundation  (October 2017-June 2018)</b>	
							<ul>
								<li>Helped build and maintain an artificial coral reef. Created a coral nursery of Acropora palmata, by collecting fragments of the species broken from colonies then attaching these to substrate or nursery trees.</li>
<li>Boat driving. Able to operate and navigate a boat and capable of picking up scuba divers without a mooring. </li>
<li>General Marine Park Maintenance. Assisted with lionfish culling and maintenance of dive sites.</li>
